# gametrader

This application was made using AngularJS and Ionic/Firebase framework. The purpose of this app was to remove a middleman from the online marketplace for used goods like eBay. You can post an ad or browse the ads by other and then contact with the person to arrange a deal. You can sell games, mention what you are looking for and then exchange them. Just like the times before GameSpot ruined it for us.
The main reason I made this was because I was running out of friends to exchange games with and GameSpot offered me 60 cents for my Uncharted disc.
